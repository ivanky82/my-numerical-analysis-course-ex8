# my-numerical-analysis-course-ex8
Created matlab/octave codes to be used in Lab 8 of my numerical analysis course. However, this is still in Indonesian language.  This exercise is about quadratures, especially the trapesium and the Simpson quadratures. We also ask the students to generate a  Romberg table.
